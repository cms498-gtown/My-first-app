# My-first-app

## Setup

Create a virtual environment (first time only):

```sh
conda create -n reports-env-2024 python=3.10
```

Activate the environment (whenever you come back to this project):

```sh
conda activate reports-env-2024
```

Install packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
[Obtain an API Key](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) from AlphaVantage.

To use SendGrid for sending email, you must first follow some setup instructions to create an account, verify your account, setup a single sender address and verify it, then finally obtain an API Key:

First, sign up for a SendGrid account, and click the verification link sent to your email address.

Then follow the instructions to complete your "Single Sender Verification", and click the verification link sent in another confirmation email to verify your single sender address (i.e. the SENDGRID_SENDER_ADDRESS). You should be able to access these settings via the "Sender Authentication" section of the settings menu.

Finally, create a SendGrid API Key with "full access" permissions (i.e. the SENDGRID_API_KEY). You should be able to access these settings via the "API Keys" section of the settings menu.

Create a ".env" file and add contents like the following (using your own AlphaVantage API Key):

```sh
# this is the ".env" file:
ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY="..."

# optionally:
SENDGRID_API_KEY="_______________"
SENDGRID_SENDER_ADDRESS="_________"
```

## Usage

```sh

# Windows OS:
# ... if `export` doesn't work for you, try `set` instead
# ... or set FLASK_APP variable via ".env" file
export FLASK_APP=web_app
flask run
```
